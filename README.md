# Country-Search
#🧩 Technical Challenge — Country Search App
This project is a small full-stack web application that allows users to search for countries in real time.

🖥️ Overview
The application displays a list of countries stored in a MongoDB database.
Users can type into a search bar, and the frontend will automatically filter and display countries whose names match the input — regardless of case (e.g., typing “united” returns both United Kingdom and United States of America).

⚙️ Technologies Used
Frontend: React (live search, dynamic rendering)
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: MongoDB Atlas (persistent country data)
Interaction Model: RESTful API (/api/countries) — Request-Response between frontend and backend

🔍 Key Features
